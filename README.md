# car-configurator
In this project, we create a personalized car configurator based on each person's interests and budget. 
You can open 'index.html' file with live server to start the configurator. 

backend.js file has the main algorithm to first filters out cars that are outside of the user's budget or does not meet the criteria. For the cars that meet all the constraints and preferences, the algorithm calculate the utility scores for the cars based on price and design preferences.
